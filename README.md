# House Price Data Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on residential house pricing data using Python.  
The goal is to understand the key factors influencing house prices, identify hidden patterns in the housing market, and generate data-driven insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

---

## Dataset
The dataset (`house_prices.csv`) includes structural, spatial, and quality-related features of residential properties, such as:

- **SalePrice** → Final sale price of the property  
- **LotArea** → Lot size in square feet  
- **OverallQual** → Overall material and finish quality  
- **YearBuilt** → Original construction year  
- Additional structural, neighborhood, and condition-based attributes  

---

## Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
git clone [(https://github.com/mnv1015/HousePrice_Preduction_Using_ML-/blob/main/HousePrice_prediction_Uisng_ML.ipynb)]
2. Open the project folder  
cd house-pricing-analysis

3. Launch the notebook  
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb

4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Analysis Included
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature correlation and visualization  
- Trend and outlier detection  
- Basic predictive analysis (if applied)  

## Key Findings
- Property quality, size, and construction year strongly impact house prices.  
- Several structural and location-based features show strong correlation with sale price.  
- Visual analysis reveals pricing outliers and non-linear relationships.
